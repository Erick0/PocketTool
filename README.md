*PocketTool Source Code*
=============================

This is the complete source of PocketTool.
To create a working build, you will need to download the following and add them to your build path:
 * [SimpleNBT](https://github.com/SpoutDev/SimpleNBT)
 * [Zip-Signer](http://code.google.com/p/zip-signer/)
 * [Spongy Castle](http://rtyley.github.com/spongycastle/) - Due to changes in Zip-Signer's API, this may also need to be linked into the APK.
 * [libsuperuser](https://github.com/Chainfire/libsuperuser)
